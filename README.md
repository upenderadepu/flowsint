## Contributing

Flowsint is still in early development and definetly needs the help of the community! Feel free to raise issues, propose features, etc.

## Get started

Don't want to read ? Got it. Here's your install instructions:

### Linux / macOS

#### 1. Install pre-requisites

- Docker
- Make

#### 2. Run install command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reconurge/flowsint.git
cd flowsint
make prod
```

### Windows

No Make needed. Works in both **Command Prompt (cmd)** and **PowerShell**.

#### 1. Install pre-requisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) (make sure it is **running** before the next step)
- Git

#### 2. Clone and set up environment files

```bat
git clone https://github.com/reconurge/flowsint.git
cd flowsint

copy .env.example .env
copy .env.example flowsint-api\.env
copy .env.example flowsint-core\.env
copy .env.example flowsint-app\.env
```

#### 3. Start

```bat
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

This pulls the pre-built images from GitHub Container Registry — no local build needed.

### First login

Then go to [http://localhost:5173/register](http://localhost:5173/register) and create an account. There are no credentials or account by default.


> ✅ OSINT investigations need a high level of privacy. Everything is stored on your machine.

### Deploy on a network (team / server)

The same setup works out of the box on a server: the frontend serves the UI **and** proxies all API calls internally, so no extra configuration is needed for clients.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reconurge/flowsint.git
cd flowsint
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — see "Before exposing to a network" below
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Anyone on the network can then access Flowsint at `http://<server-ip>:5173`.

**Before exposing to a network, change the default secrets in `.env`:**

- `AUTH_SECRET` — signs authentication tokens. Generate one: `openssl rand -hex 32`
- `MASTER_VAULT_KEY_V1` — encrypts stored API keys. Generate one: `python3 -c "import os, base64; print('base64:' + base64.b64encode(os.urandom(32)).decode())"`
- `NEO4J_PASSWORD` — Neo4j database password.

**Also add your server hostname/IP to the Host-header allowlist** in `flowsint-app/nginx.conf` (look for `map $http_host $is_flowsint_host`). The default allowlist accepts only `localhost` / `127.0.0.1` / `[::1]`, which defends single-user installs against DNS rebinding; LAN and public deploys must opt-in their own hostname. Two commented-out template lines in the same map block show the format.

Only port `5173` is exposed to the network. PostgreSQL, Redis, Neo4j and the API are bound to `127.0.0.1` on the server and reachable only through the frontend proxy.

To pin a specific version instead of `latest`, set `FLOWSINT_VERSION` in `.env` (e.g. `FLOWSINT_VERSION=1.2.10`).

**HTTPS (recommended beyond a trusted LAN):** put any reverse proxy in front of port 5173. Example with [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/):

```
flowsint.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:5173
}
```

When fronting with a reverse proxy, also bind the app port to localhost in `docker-compose.prod.yml` (`"127.0.0.1:5173:8080"`) so clients can only go through HTTPS.


## What is it?

Flowsint is a graph-based investigation tool focused on reconnaissance and OSINT (Open Source Intelligence). It allows you to explore relationships between entities through a visual graph interface and automated enrichers.

- Subdomain Discovery - Enumerate subdomains
- WHOIS Lookup - Get domain registration information
- Domain to Website - Convert domain to website entity
- Domain to Root Domain - Extract root domain
- Domain to ASN - Find ASN associated with domain
- Domain History - Retrieve historical domain data

**IP Enrichers**
- IP Information - Get geolocation and network details
- IP to ASN - Find ASN for IP address

**ASN Enrichers**
- ASN to CIDRs - Get IP ranges for an ASN

**CIDR Enrichers**
